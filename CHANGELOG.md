## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A Claude desktop app for every saved Claude account. Each gets a small
  launcher in `~/Applications/Claude Accounts/` that opens Claude.app against
  that account's own data directory (`--user-data-dir`), so two or more
  accounts can be open side by side, each keeping its own sign-in, chats and
  MCP settings. Claude.app itself is never copied, modified or re-signed, so
  it keeps its updater, its passkeys and its Microsoft sign-in. Pressing
  Refresh creates launchers for new accounts, rebuilds ones whose account,
  logo or Claude version changed, and moves the ones whose account was
  removed to the Trash. The account's desktop data is kept, so saving it
  again brings it back still signed in. A launcher whose Claude is already
  running brings that window forward instead of opening a second copy.
- A logo for each account. Choose an image from the account's desktop menu,
  and it becomes the launcher's icon in the Dock, Finder and Spotlight.
  Without one, the icon is Claude's own with the account's initial on a
  coloured badge.
- Usage figures from the Claude desktop app. Each account's desktop app logs
  its 5-hour and 7-day spend while it is open, and Janus now shows that when
  it is newer than anything else it has, labelled "measured … in the Claude
  app". An account whose Claude Code sign-in has lapsed still shows current
  figures as long as its desktop app has run. The app logs no reset times, so
  those are carried over from an earlier reading of the same window when
  there is one.

### Changed

- Janus is now a menu bar panel rather than a window with a menu attached.
  Clicking its menu bar item opens a popover showing the Claude Code and Codex
  accounts in use, with their limits, above a grid of tiles: switch to the
  next account (`⌘S` for Claude Code), pick any account, clear caches,
  refresh (`⌘R`), manage (`⌘,`) and quit (`⌘Q`). The full window is still
  there, behind Manage, for reordering, removing, desktop logos and choosing
  which caches go. Janus no longer has a Dock icon except while that window is
  open.

### Fixed

- A saved account that Claude Code had signed out no longer loses its
  sign-in for good. Switching away from it used to save the emptied tokens
  over the working ones Janus already held; those are now kept, and only the
  settings file is updated. An account already saved signed out says so on
  its row ("switch to it, sign in again") instead of repeating "Press
  Refresh", and a row whose last fetch failed shows why.
- A signed-in Claude Code account is no longer reported as signed out when a
  `~/.claude/.claude.json` exists. That file is not the live one on a default
  install; it is what Claude Code writes when started with
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude`, and other tools leave one behind holding only
  caches. Janus now finds the session the way Claude Code does: `~/.claude.json`
  (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json`, or a pre-1.0 `.config.json`), with the
  keychain entry under `Claude Code-credentials`, suffixed with the hash of the
  configuration directory when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` moves it, and the keychain
  account taken from `$USER` as Claude Code takes it.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- A Codex tab, for switching between OpenAI Codex accounts the way the Claude
  tab switches Claude Code ones. The window's tabs are now Claude, Codex and
  Storage. Codex keeps its whole sign-in in `~/.codex/auth.json`, so a switch
  saves that file under the account it belongs to and writes the other
  account's in its place; saved sign-ins live in the login keychain under
  `Janus Codex`. The displaced sign-in is saved again on every switch, because
  Codex rotates its single-use refresh tokens and an older copy stops working.
  The same email in two ChatGPT workspaces is kept as two accounts, and API-key
  sign-ins are supported. Refresh fetches each ChatGPT account's five-hour and
  weekly limits from OpenAI, and a switch made while Codex is running says so,
  since a running Codex can write its old account back. To add a second
  account, delete `~/.codex/auth.json` and run `codex login`. `codex logout`
  revokes the sign-in at OpenAI, which kills the copy Janus just saved.
- The menu bar lists the Codex account alongside the Claude Code one, with a
  one-click switch to the next.
- `~/.codex` is guarded from cache clearing, as `~/.claude` already was.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Refresh now asks Anthropic for each account's figures rather than only
  re-reading what Claude Code left on disk. A saved account's numbers used to be
  frozen at the moment it was last signed out, because that file is the only
  place they were written and nothing writes to it while the account is parked.
  One request per account, made with the tokens that account already has saved,
  and the line under each pair of bars says whether you are looking at a fetched
  figure or a remembered one. A fetched figure is kept, so it survives the app
  being quit and gives the account a current cache the next time it signs in.
  Expired tokens are renewed first, and what comes back is stored before it is
  used for anything else. The signed-in account is never renewed by Janus: a
  running Claude Code session is holding that token, and Claude Code keeps it
  fresh itself.
- The window keeps its own time. Countdowns run down and a limit that passes its
  reset empties itself while the window sits open, instead of waiting for
  something to force a redraw — a row drawn at nine used to still be claiming
  "resets in 2h 22m" at midnight. A window actually turning over also triggers a
  fetch, since that is the moment the old figure stops describing anything.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Repeated requests for the login keychain password, from Janus and from Claude
  Code alike. Keychain entries carry a partition list naming the code allowed to
  open them, and writing them through the Security framework quietly re-stamped
  that list with Janus's own signature, shutting Claude Code out of its own
  tokens and shutting Janus out again after every rebuild. Entries now go through
  `/usr/bin/security`, which is what Claude Code uses and what leaves them in a
  partition both can reopen. Saved accounts are mended the next time they are
  switched to.
- A switch no longer overwrites the live session when the keychain refuses to
  hand over its tokens. The refusal used to be indistinguishable from nobody
  being signed in, so the switch carried on and the displaced account was left
  needing a fresh sign-in.
- Refresh now folds the signed-in account's figures into its saved copy, so they
  are not lost when it is switched away from, and says what it could and could
  not bring up to date. Only the signed-in account's figures can move, which the
  button now explains rather than leaving people to press it again.
- A limit whose reset has passed no longer reads "resetting now" forever, and no
  longer shows the spend of the window that ended as though it were the current
  one. It is drawn empty with a dash and says "last reset 4h ago"; the weekly
  figure is left alone until its own reset comes round. Claude Code measures only
  while a session is running, so the signed-in account is now told to start one,
  and the help popover explains where the figures come from at all.
- The window comes forward before any operation that can raise a keychain prompt,
  so a prompt drawn behind another app no longer looks like a hung switch, and
  the busy state is cleared on every path out.

### Added

- Regression tests pinning down that reordering the rotation never alters, drops
  or duplicates a saved account. Accounts are keyed by UUID rather than by
  position, so their place in the list is not part of how they are stored.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-25

First public release.

### Added

- Switch between saved Claude Code accounts from a window or the menu bar, with
  the live session swapped in place and the displaced one saved automatically.
- Save the signed-in account with one press; an account signed in outside the app
  is adopted rather than overwritten when switching away from it.
- Per-account five-hour and weekly limit usage, read from the settings file
  Claude Code writes, with saved accounts labelled by when their figures were
  taken.
- A reorderable rotation, so `⌘S` from the menu bar moves through accounts in the
  order you choose.
- A storage tab that measures a catalogue of developer and application caches and
  moves the selected ones to the Trash, refusing anything outside the home
  directory and anything held open by a running app.
- Universal builds published as a `.dmg` and a `.zip` with SHA-256 checksums.
